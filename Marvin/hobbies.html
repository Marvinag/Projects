				<li>Gaming</li>
					This is what I like doing most in my free time and enjoy it best with friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Travel</li>
					Travelling to me is a very engaging activity and gemerally frees the mind.
					The interaction with new people are what matter most and that makes me happy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Swimming</li>
					Even though this has been constantly difficult for me to do, it comes as great enjoyment and I love it.
